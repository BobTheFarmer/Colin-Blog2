<ul>
<li>Beneficial Effect: Advancements in robotics and automation through the use of computational models and algorithms in manufacturing and industrial processes.</li>
<li>
<p>Harmful Effect: Job displacement and income inequality as certain tasks and roles become automated, particularly in low-skilled and low-wage positions. Additionally, there is a risk of reduced worker safety as automation and robots may replace human workers in hazardous environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beneficial Effect: Improved financial services through the use of big data and artificial intelligence in banking and financial markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmful Effect: Increased financial inequality as certain individuals and groups may have limited access to these services or may be excluded from the benefits of these technologies due to factors such as income or credit score. Additionally, there is a risk of bias and discrimination in decision-making based on data-driven predictions, particularly in areas such as lending and insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beneficial Effect: Enhanced national security through the use of surveillance and facial recognition technology.</p>
</li>
<li>Harmful Effect: Invasion of privacy, particularly for individuals who may be targeted for surveillance based on their race, religion, or political beliefs. Additionally, there is a risk of false positives and false negatives in facial recognition technology, which can lead to individuals being wrongly targeted or not identified in situations where identification is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computers and technology have changed the way we live and work in a lot of ways. They've made things faster and easier, like how we can order groceries online or video call our friends and family across the world. They've also helped us make breakthroughs in medicine, transportation, and energy. And let's not forget how much easier it is to bank and shop online.</p>
<p>However, computers and technology can also lead to job losses, privacy issues, and even addiction. And not everyone has equal access to all the benefits of technology, which can widen the gap even more.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it's important to remember that computers and technology are just tools. They can be used for good or bad, it depends on how we use them. While we need to be aware of the negative effects, we should also focus on the positive impact they've had on our lives and the world we live in.</p>

<p>In my opinion, these issues are real and should be thought about more. The specific details about Anthony Rosner's experience and how it impacted his life, as well as the studies cited that show how video games and social media can impact people chemically, lend credibility to the message. It's not some wild conspiracy theory, but a real issue that we should be aware of.</p>
<p>As a student in high school, reading this text definitely made me reflect on my own habits and how much time I spend on my phone and on video games. I definitely don't want to neglect my schoolwork and relationships like Anthony did. It's a reminder to be mindful of how much time I spend on screens and to make sure I'm using it in a way that's balanced and doesn't negatively impact my life.</p>
<p>I also think it's important to remember that everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for another. For example, I might be able to play video games for a few hours a day and still maintain a good balance in my life, while for someone else, even a short amount of time might be too much. It's important to be aware of the potential negative effects of excessive use of video games and social media and to find a balance that works for you and your life goals. We should also be mindful of the effects on our mental and physical health.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the text is a valuable reminder to be aware of how much time we spend on screens, and to make sure we're using it in a way that's balanced and doesn't negatively impact our life. It's important to be mindful of the effects on our mental and physical health. It's a good reminder to find a balance that works for you and your life goals.</p>

<p>I thought of four ways to help empower yourself in the digital world:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Establish clear boundaries: One of the key ways to empower ourselves in a digital world is to establish clear boundaries around our use of technology. This might mean setting limits on the amount of time we spend on social media each day, or disabling notifications for certain apps during certain hours of the day. By setting these boundaries, we can ensure that technology is serving us, rather than the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a digital detox: Sometimes, it can be helpful to take a break from technology altogether. This might mean going on a digital detox, where you unplug from all technology for a set period of time. This can help to reset our relationship with technology and remind us of the importance of being present in the world around us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be mindful of our digital footprint: Our online behavior can have real-world consequences, so it's important to be mindful of our digital footprint. This might mean being cautious about what we post online, or thinking twice before sharing personal information. By being mindful of our digital footprint, we can ensure that our online behavior aligns with our values and that we maintain control of our digital identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use technology to our advantage: Finally, we can empower ourselves in a digital world by using technology to our advantage. This might mean using apps or tools to help us stay organized and on task, or using social media to connect with like-minded individuals and build a supportive community. By using technology in a way that serves us, we can ensure that it's a positive force in our lives.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>One action that can be taken at school is to educate and inform others about the importance of digital literacy and online safety. This can be done by leading workshops or presentations in class, creating informational materials, or even starting a club or group dedicated to teaching these skills.</p>
<p>Another way to help those who are not empowered is to be an ally and advocate for them. This can be done by standing up against cyberbullying, supporting those who have been targeted, and educating others about the negative effects of online harassment. Additionally, it can be helpful to share resources and information about how to stay safe and protect oneself online.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a person who is empowered can also help by being a role model. This can be done by demonstrating positive digital habits and being mindful of how one's actions online can affect others. Additionally, being an active participant in online communities and promoting healthy and positive digital interactions can also be a way to empower others.</p>
<p>Overall, being an empowered digital citizen means not only taking care of oneself but also actively working to create a safer and more equitable online environment for everyone. By educating, advocating, and being a role model, one can help empower those around them in the digital world.</p>

<p>There are several barriers to digital empowerment that can be found at school and in other settings. One of the main barriers is a lack of access to technology. This can be due to financial constraints, as many low-income families may not have the resources to purchase computers or internet access. Additionally, some schools may not have the necessary resources to provide all students with access to technology.</p>
<p>Another barrier to digital empowerment is a lack of digital literacy skills. Many individuals may not have the knowledge or skills necessary to effectively use technology, which can prevent them from fully utilizing its potential. This is particularly true for older individuals or those who have not had much exposure to technology in the past.</p>
<p>Finally, there may be cultural or societal barriers to digital empowerment. For example, some individuals may not see the value in technology or may have negative perceptions of it, which can prevent them from using it to its full potential.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
