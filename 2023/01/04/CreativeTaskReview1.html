<p>The way the performance task is scored is meant to encourage students to consistently demonstrate their understanding of their own code and the various coding techniques they have implemented. This can be done through effective problem-solving and debugging, as well as being able to clearly and accurately explain the purpose and function of the code they have written. By encouraging students to have a thorough understanding of their own code, it helps to ensure the quality and reliability of the programs they create, and it can also help them to identify and fix any issues that may arise. Ultimately, the goal of this scoring method is to help students become proficient and confident programmers who are able to produce high-quality code that is both functional and efficient.</p>
