<p>The performance task is scored to encourage consentient and high quality code. Each category requires an extremely detailed description of your code. Although it does not need to be complex, it needs to be very consistent and support each of the requirements thoroughly. The focus is also on using coding techniques to simplify and make your code run faster and be more readable. It is ultimately not about how long your code is, it is about how well it works.</p>

<p>I will create a list of famous destinations. Each building will contain its own likes which will sort them by most to least liked. It will incorporate html to build the base, css to create the style, and a postman api to store the likes.

<p>I will demonstrate how the likes are stored and updated against multiple users. I will also show the page which hosts all the content. I want to keep the video short and simple because that is what other people found success with, from my research.</p>

<li>Tourists could choose destinations based on how much other recommend them</li>
<li>It can become easier for people to get a quick overview of places around the world and it could improve their knowledge</li>
<li>People can contribute and add their own opinions, so it will always be improving</li>

<p>If a location is lowly rated it will appear low which could prevent it from every gaining a lot of likes if it improves, which could draw tourism away from cool areas. To combat this I could add a sort by lowest to highest for people who want to see a larger variety.</p>

<p>The biggest pro is that clubs and individuals can easily access the internet and people who could potentially not have access otherwise can easily use it. However, a big con is the potential for abuse of the computers.</p>

</h2>
<p>As someone who has access to the internet all the time I am not concerned about the digital divide for myself and I don't know anyone who is personally affected. However, on a global scale I do worry in general for others who are affected by this. I am concerned that they will not be able to benefit from progression from other areas because they cannot accesses it.</p>
