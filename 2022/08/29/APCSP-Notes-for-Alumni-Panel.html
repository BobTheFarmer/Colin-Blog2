<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge you’ve faced?</strong></p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Temptation to cut corners, not everything is a checkbox for points</p>

  <p>Starting in a new area of CS</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Are there any project based learning scenarios in college CS classes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You do only 2; in your freshman and senior years</p>

  <p>PBL then tests; split between</p>

  <p>Not as much in class but you can work in smaller groups</p>

  <p>Dealing with other people is hard</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can write scripts to automate some stuff and will serve you well (2x)</p>

  <p>Advanced calculations</p>

  <p>3D printing</p>

  <p>Advanced calculations and math calculations</p>

  <p>Jupyter notebooks can be used for technical papers</p>

  <p>Stats majors and psychology need CS</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>For existing college students, have you had a job with a school or professor</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be different for references</p>

  <p>You can be a bus driver</p>

  <p>Code Ninjas</p>

  <p>Northrop Grumman; technical drawing revisions visualizing flight data and cybersecurity, scripting for staffing spreadsheet (x3)</p>

  <p>LG; APIs, internal APIs, html, python</p>

  <p>APCSA got them the internship</p>

  <p>Church group</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, important to get a job, have 2-3</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Isolate and cut out extra text thats attached to models</p>

  <p>Manipulation of commands</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Did you do any Del Norte Computer science clubs</strong></p>
