            "content": "HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . A decidable problem is a problem that is possible to determine whether a given solution is correct, while an undecidable problem is a problem that is not possible to determine whether a given solution is correct. An example of a decidable problem is solving an equation, while an example of an undecidable problem is determining whether a given computer program will run forever or halt. . HACK 2 .

HACK 4: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): # create a new empty list sorted_lst = [] # loop over the unsorted list until it is empty while len(data) &gt; 0: min_val = min(data) data.remove(min_val) sorted_lst.append(min_val) print(sorted_lst) if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data2 = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data2) .

HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . from array import array def faster_heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data.swap(i, n-1) else: data.swap(0, n-1) if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = array(&#39;i&#39;, [1, 2, 3]) heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . array(&#39;i&#39;, [1, 2, 3]) array(&#39;i&#39;, [2, 1, 3]) array(&#39;i&#39;, [3, 1, 2]) array(&#39;i&#39;, [1, 3, 2]) array(&#39;i&#39;, [2, 3, 1]) array(&#39;i&#39;, [3, 2, 1]) . Extra notes . Algorithm efficiency refers to how well a computer program performs in terms of its usage of resources such as time and memory. An efficient algorithm can complete its tasks quickly and with minimal use of resources, while an inefficient algorithm may take a long time to complete or use up a large amount of memory. . Undecidable problems are problems for which there is no known algorithm that can always produce a correct solution. These problems are typically impossible to solve using a computer program, as there is no way to guarantee that the program will always find the correct solution. Examples of undecidable problems include the halting problem and the problem of determining whether a given statement in a formal system is true or false. . In summary, algorithm efficiency is a measure of how well a computer program performs, while undecidable problems are those that cannot be solved using a computer program. .",

            "content": "Score and first glance thoughts . I got a 47/50 on the MCQ2. I feel like that is a pretty good score and I think I was able to get it because of the peer lessons. Overall I think I need to pratice my speed because it took me a while to do the algorithm based questions and I might run out of time on the real AP test because it is even longer. . Missed questions and how I can be better . Q17: Which of the following code segments produce the same result as the statement above for all possible values of val1 and val2? . I initially thought that the solution to the problem would only be achievable through either option A or option B. However, after giving it more thought and consideration, I realized that option D can also work as a solution. This is because the else statement in option D enables me to simulate the AND statement by taking into account all possible input variations of the two Booleans. This newfound understanding showed me that my initial perception of the problem was limited, and that there was a more complex solution that I hadn&#39;t initially considered. . Q22: Find average height of students . On this question, I initially thought that algorithm A would not be effective. This was because I misunderstood the meaning of &quot;a randomly selected student,&quot; as I believed it referred to any student in the pool, including those whose height had already been recorded. However, upon further examination, I now understand that when a student sits down, they are no longer considered in the pool and are therefore not a potential source of error in the algorithm. I believe this confusion was caused by the unclear wording in the question, and I do not think encountering similar issues on the actual test is very likley as the questions are typically more clearly written. . Q30: Use drawCircle to draw figure on a coordinate grid . I originally only considered options A and B and did not take into account alternative answer C. However, upon further examination, I realized that it is possible to go through the algorithm backwards to obtain the same result. In the future, I think it would be wise for me to thoroughly check all the answers for questions like this and Q17, rather than just relying on my initial choice. To do so, I may need to make adjustments and allocate less time elsewhere in order to allow for a more comprehensive examination of all answers. . Conclusion . My main concern at the moment is my speed. On the actual test, taking the time to be meticulous could result in me not being able to complete all the questions. Specifically, the part that takes me the longest is double-checking my answers on algorithm questions as I currently perform the steps in my head. To address this, I plan to consider reversing the algorithm as it may help me better recall the variables. Additionally, if I have extra time during the test, I will take a moment to double-check my second choices on multiple-answer questions. .",

            "content": "5.1 . Pros and Cons of developing technolgy . Beneficial Effect: Advancements in robotics and automation through the use of computational models and algorithms in manufacturing and industrial processes. | Harmful Effect: Job displacement and income inequality as certain tasks and roles become automated, particularly in low-skilled and low-wage positions. Additionally, there is a risk of reduced worker safety as automation and robots may replace human workers in hazardous environments. . | Beneficial Effect: Improved financial services through the use of big data and artificial intelligence in banking and financial markets. . | Harmful Effect: Increased financial inequality as certain individuals and groups may have limited access to these services or may be excluded from the benefits of these technologies due to factors such as income or credit score. Additionally, there is a risk of bias and discrimination in decision-making based on data-driven predictions, particularly in areas such as lending and insurance. . | Beneficial Effect: Enhanced national security through the use of surveillance and facial recognition technology. . | Harmful Effect: Invasion of privacy, particularly for individuals who may be targeted for surveillance based on their race, religion, or political beliefs. Additionally, there is a risk of false positives and false negatives in facial recognition technology, which can lead to individuals being wrongly targeted or not identified in situations where identification is necessary. | . Computers and technology have changed the way we live and work in a lot of ways. They&#39;ve made things faster and easier, like how we can order groceries online or video call our friends and family across the world. They&#39;ve also helped us make breakthroughs in medicine, transportation, and energy. And let&#39;s not forget how much easier it is to bank and shop online. . However, computers and technology can also lead to job losses, privacy issues, and even addiction. And not everyone has equal access to all the benefits of technology, which can widen the gap even more. . At the end of the day, it&#39;s important to remember that computers and technology are just tools. They can be used for good or bad, it depends on how we use them. While we need to be aware of the negative effects, we should also focus on the positive impact they&#39;ve had on our lives and the world we live in. . Dopamine and it&#39;s issues . I think that dopamine is a real problem that should be taken much more seriously. Anthony Rosner describes his grades and life being damaged a lot by his gaming addiction. I think that these issues should be taken more seriously and not be thought of as some kind of conspiracy to prevent kids from playing to many video games. . This text definitely made me think about my own use of technology, like phones and video games. I want to avoid neglecting my relationships and schoolwork. Being a student in high school, I think this is important for both me and my peers to remember how much time we spend on screens. . Finally, I think it is also important to remember that everyone has their own responsibilitys and that what works for one person may not work for another. Some people will be able to play more videogames or spend more time on their phones while others may fall out of touch and productiviy when they spend too much time on their phones. Whats really important is to try and mantian a balance between their personal lives and their dopamine. . 5.2 . Digital empowerment . I thought of three ways to help empower yourself in the digital world: . Establish clear boundaries for a balance: One very important way to become digitally empowered is to establish a clear line of how much time you spend on your devices. One really good strategy for this is to use tools like screen time on certain apps to set limits or disable them during certain hours of the day. These boundaries make sure you do not spend too much time chasing dopamine. . | Digital footprint: Online behavior can affect us in the real world too so we need to remember that and be mindful of our digital footprint. We could be careful about what we post and think before we post any information that is too personal. If we are mindful of our digital footprint, we make sure that our online behavior could never harm us in the real world and we make sure we control our digital identity. . | However, we can also use technology to empower ourselves by taking control of our technology and taking advantage of its benefits. Applications can be used to keep us organized or to help us focus on our work. Social media can also be used to connect with people who share similar interests. If we use technology to help us we can truly become digitally empowered. . | In the game below, try to click which method you think is best to be digitally empowered in each row: . . Buying followers on social media Purchasing likes and comments on posts Creating multiple accounts to promote yourself Networking and building genuine relationships online Pretending to be someone else online Being authentic and true to yourself online Buying fake testimonials or reviews Purchasing fake certificates or qualifications Using automated tools to spam others Stealing content and passing it off as your own Creating original and valuable content Sending unsolicited messages or emails Using personal information of others without permission Engaging in cyberbullying or harassment Participating in online scams or frauds Respecting other people&#39;s privacy and boundaries online (Disclaimer I did not write all of the examples)&lt;/p&gt; Steps to help with digital enpowerment at DNHS . Education about digital safety can be very important at school to help students practice online safety. Some good ways to do this include presentations about digital safety which can be made in class, informational materials, and clubs which are for teaching this. . One more way to help people to become digitally empowered is to help stand up against negative things on the internet, like cyberbullying. We can do this by helping people who are targeted and by educating people about the problems that can come with cyberbullying. Also, it is very helpful to share your resources about how to be digitally empowered. . Furthermore, a person who is empowered can also help by being a role model. This can be done by demonstrating positive digital habits and being mindful of how one&#39;s actions online can affect others. Additionally, being an active participant in online communities and promoting healthy and positive digital interactions can also be a way to empower others. . Additionally, you can be a role model to help others become empowered. We can be role models by showing others good digital habits and by being extremely mindful of how your actions can affect people on the internet. Participating in communities online and using good digital habits can be a good way to help others improve their digital empowerment. . . Barriers to digital empowerment . However, there are many barriers which can prevent people from becoming digitally empowered. The biggest barrier is when people do not have access to technology. This could be caused by a lack of enough money to afford rapidly evolving tech or having no internet access. In addition, schools in low income areas could not have enough resources to help those who don&#39;t have access to the internet . Another barrier to digital empowerment is a lack of digital literacy skills. Many individuals may not have the knowledge or skills necessary to effectively use technology, which can prevent them from fully utilizing its potential. This is particularly true for older individuals or those who have not had much exposure to technology in the past. . In addition, some people never have the opportunity to become good at using tech and never get the skills to use technology effectivity which stops them from using it well and acts as a another barrier to using tech. This could become a even bigger problem for older people or people who have never used tech in the past. . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; .",

They included a minimal description but it didn&#39;t explain how the algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it. . Row 6 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 They described two different calls to the specific procedure, and explained how the conditions being tested would result in different code being executed. They also explained what the conditions were. They described the first call sent was &#39;dog&#39; which was a correct guess and the second call sent was &#39;mouse&#39; which was an incorrect guess, and explained how the conditions being tested work in the procedure. . Submission 2 . Row 1 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 The video demonstrates the running of the program, showing input into the program through keyboard typing and output includes the prompts for the word input and the poems being displayed. The program&#39;s purpose is creative expression, “to explore the user’s creativity through the expression of poetry using their words and images as well as preferences of formatting in order to generate some unique poems.” They also described the functionality demonstrated in the video and input and output, how the program generates poems according to the user&#39;s inputs and specifications. . Row 2 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 They provided two distinct code segments, the first showing data being stored in the identified list and the second showing the data being accessed from the identified list under a new name since it is passed as a parameter. The name of the list is identified as nounList, although it is also referred to as wordList when it is passed into the selectWord procedure. They also identified what is stored in the list, the nouns that must be in certain specific locations within the poem. . Row 3 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 They included code that uses lists of words to manage complexity when generating poetry. They also explained how the code would be written differently without the list and how it would make the code more cluttered. . Row 4 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 They included a student-developed procedure, createPoems, with four parameters that are used in the procedure. They described the functionality of the procedure as it states that it is “putting together the final selection of poems.” The procedure contributes to the overall program by building poems according to how many the user specified and whether the user wanted articles in the poems. . Row 5 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 They used sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (while loop) in their algorithm. They also explained in detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be recreated. The algorithm works by sequentially first defining a variable to count the number of poems generated and defines an empty string to hold the poem being generated, then it starts a while loop that continues until the number of poems specified by the user is reached. Within the while loop, the algorithm uses the selection statement to check if the user wants articles included in the poem and uses the iteration to select words from the list and append them to the string. . Row 6 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 They described two different calls to the specific procedure, and explained how the conditions being tested would result in different code being executed. They also explained what the conditions were. They described the first call sent was &#39;dog&#39; which was a correct guess and the second call sent was &#39;mouse&#39; which was an incorrect guess, and explained how the conditions being tested work in the procedure. . Submission 3 . Row 1 - (0 Points) - I gave 0 The student didn&#39;t quite get this one. They demonstrated the running of the program, showing input into the program using the drop-down menus to select two characters for the battle and output consisting of a display of the values for the various rankings of each character and the winner of the battle using an image. They also described the functionality demonstrated in the video and input and output, however, they only described the function of the program but not its purpose. . Row 2 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 This student hit the mark with this one. They provided two code segments, the first segment shows data being stored in the identified list, and a second segment shows data being accessed from the list in a loop via a parameter that is set to the identified list. The list is identified in the response as firstCharacterList, and the data within the list represents the power rankings and URL for the image of the character that was selected from the first drop-down box. . Row 3 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 This student hit the mark with this one. They included a list that combines six rankings and an image URL for a single character into one collection to pass to the function that determines a winner, managing complexity in the program code. They also provided an accurate explanation about what would happen if the list were not used, it would make the code longer and more cumbersome. . Row 4 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 This student hit the mark with this one. They included a student-developed procedure, findWinner, with two parameters that are used in the procedure. They also included another code segment that illustrates a call to the findWinner procedure. They described the function of the procedure, and how it contributes to the overall program by determining the hypothetical winner in a battle between two Marvel Characters. . Row 5 - (0 Points) - I gave 0 This student didn&#39;t quite get this one. They explained how the algorithm within the procedure works, but it doesn&#39;t explain it in enough detail that someone else could recreate it. They explained it in a minimal description, but it didn&#39;t give a full understanding of how the algorithm works. . Row 6 - (1 Points) - I gave 1 This student hit the mark with this one. They explained how the array manages complexity and how the code would be written differently without the array. They provided an accurate explanation of how the array allows them to store multiple words at once and easily reference them without having to create separate variables for each word. They also explained how it makes the code more organized and efficient. . Submission 4 . Row 1: (1 Points) - I gave 1 They demonstrated the program running and collecting input from the user, as well as displaying output on the screen. They also explained the program&#39;s purpose and how it works, and described the input and output. . Row 2: (0 Points) - I gave 0 The student&#39;s program did not pass all of the criteria in this row. They provided two code segments, but the data stored in the list was not being used, only the length of the list was accessed. They also identified the name of the list as guesses and explained that it represented the user&#39;s word inputs, but the use of the list did not manage complexity in the program. . Row 3: (0 Points) - I gave 0 The student&#39;s program did not pass any of the criteria in this row. They included a list in the program code, but it was not used to manage complexity. They also did not explain how the list manages complexity. . Row 4: (1 Points) - I gave 1 The student&#39;s program passed all of the criteria in this row. They included a student-developed procedure called isitcorrect, with one explicit parameter, checkanswer, and a call to this procedure in a second code segment using the argument, answer. They also described the functionality of the procedure, and how it contributes to the overall program. . Row 5: (1 points) - I gave 1 The student&#39;s program passed all of the criteria in this row. They included a student-developed algorithm within the procedure isitcorrect that included sequencing, selection (an if statement), and iteration (a repeat loop). They also explained how the algorithm works in detail, including how it uses iteration to check the position and accuracy of the letters in the user&#39;s input. . Row 6: (1 Points) - I gave 1 The student&#39;s program passed all of the criteria in this row. They provided a flowchart that accurately represents the program&#39;s logic, including the use of iteration, selection and sequencing. They also explained how the flowchart represents the program&#39;s logic. . Summary / What I learned . When trying to meet these standards, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it&#39;s important to make sure that the program being demonstrated in the video is running correctly and that it is clear in the video how input is being entered and how output is being displayed. This includes showing the program running, showing input being entered using the appropriate method (such as a text entry field), and showing the output results on the screen. Next, it&#39;s important to clearly state the purpose of the program. This could be something like &quot;to test critical thinking skills&quot; as in the example above. This helps to give context to the functionality that is being demonstrated in the video. It&#39;s also important to clearly describe the functionality that is being demonstrated in the video. This includes things like how the user interacts with the program, what happens when different buttons are clicked, and what the output looks like. Another important aspect is describing the input and output of the program. This includes what the user is inputting and what the program is outputting in response. When it comes to writing code, it&#39;s important to use data structures like lists to manage complexity in the program. This can include things like combining multiple pieces of information into a single collection, or using a list to keep track of multiple items. It&#39;s also important to explain how the use of these data structures helps to simplify the code and make it more efficient. Additionally, creating student-developed procedures and algorithms is important. These should have clear parameters and should be called correctly in other parts of the code. The procedures should also have clear functionality and the algorithms should include proper sequencing, selection and iteration. It&#39;s also important to pay attention to the naming conventions of variables and procedures. They should be clearly and accurately named, although naming the procedure is not required for all the rows. Overall, it&#39;s important to pay attention to all these aspects when trying to meet these standards, in order to create a clear, efficient, and well-functioning program. .",

The way the performance task is scored is meant to encourage students to consistently demonstrate their understanding of their own code and the various coding techniques they have implemented. This can be done through effective problem-solving and debugging, as well as being able to clearly and accurately explain the purpose and function of the code they have written. By encouraging students to have a thorough understanding of their own code, it helps to ensure the quality and reliability of the programs they create, and it can also help them to identify and fix any issues that may arise. Ultimately, the goal of this scoring method is to help students become proficient and confident programmers who are able to produce high-quality code that is both functional and efficient. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Reflection/Summary . A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used by a programmer to help them more easily accomplish a task. This is particularly useful for tasks that are common or repetitive, as the programmer can simply use the code from the library rather than having to write it from scratch each time. Using a library can save time and effort for the programmer, as they do not have to reinvent the wheel each time they need to perform a common task. However, it is important to carefully consider which library to use, as different libraries may have different strengths and weaknesses, and using the wrong library for a task can lead to problems. . One example of a library is the random library, which contains functions for generating random values. These random values can be used in a variety of ways, such as in simulations or games to add an element of chance, or in machine learning algorithms to help with training. Using a library can save time and effort for the programmer, as they do not have to reinvent the wheel each time they need to perform a common task. However, it is important to carefully consider which library to use, as different libraries may have different strengths and weaknesses, and using the wrong library for a task can lead to problems. . MCs . 1: B, random is inclusive by definition | 2: A, this is the order they would be in | 3: A, all the other ones where taught but random:item does not exsist # Short Answer Qs | 1: The main advantage of using libraries is that they provide pre-written code that you can use in your own programs. This can save a lot of time and effort, because you don&#39;t have to write the code yourself. Additionally, because the code in a library has been used and tested by many other people, it is generally more reliable and efficient than code that you might write yourself. Using libraries can also make it easier to develop programs that are more complex and sophisticated, because the code in a library can provide a foundation that you can build upon. | 2: The code is a simple program that takes a list of names from the user and randomly selects one of the names to be the person who will pay for a meal. | . First, the code imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers. . Next, the code prompts the user for a list of names, which are entered as a string with the names separated by commas. The input string is then split using the split() method, which creates a list of the individual names. . The code then finds the number of names in the list using the len() function, and uses this value to generate a random integer using the random.randint() function. This random integer is used as an index to select one of the names from the list. . Finally, the selected name is printed to the screen. . Code . 1: | . import random # List of names names = [&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Heidi&quot;, &quot;Isabel&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Karen&quot;, &quot;Liam&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Nancy&quot;, &quot;Olivia&quot;, &quot;Pat&quot;, &quot;Queenie&quot;, &quot;Richard&quot;, &quot;Samantha&quot;, &quot;Trevor&quot;, &quot;Ursula&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot;, &quot;Wanda&quot;, &quot;Xander&quot;, &quot;Yolanda&quot;, &quot;Zach&quot;] # Pick five random names from the list random_names = random.sample(names, 5) # Print the selected names print(&quot;The five random names are:&quot;) for name in random_names: print(name) .

Finally, I will blog about the AP exam and what need to change in the future. . N@TM . 3D Animation . 3D Animation is a very cool class and I liked looking at the art. It was interesting because of the variety 3D animation allows. There were all sorts of art, like: . Realism | Abstract | A mix between both It was also cool because it is another class that deals with computers | . Visual Arts . Visual arts was the class I spent the longest in excluding computers science. The art was very impressive and I enjoyed this section a lot. This art inspired me to be more thoghtful in my work for this class. . Computer Science . The various computer science projects that other groups made were very cool and impressive. One of my favorite projects was Code hoots. It had random computer science questions that the user got to answer. The project was very polished, you could even make an account and the buttons had custom animations. This project in particular inspires me to be more careful with my projects in the future. . Images . . College board final corrections . I got a 41/50 on this test. Here is what I did wrong and should change next time: . Missed questions . Feedback from CB on each missed question . Question #5 . Information about which restaurants Brandon and Cynthia have visited in the past is not needed. Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. . Question #16 . Messages are broken into as many packets as are needed to transmit the data. Each packet contains both data and metadata. . Question #18 . The Internet is not a data stream. . Question #22 . Binary 0110 is equivalent to 2^2+21. . Question #24 . Binary 1101 is equivalent to decimal 13 and should be placed after decimal 12. . Question #35 . This code segment assigns maxPS the value 50 when time &gt; 120 and assigns maxPS the value 30 otherwise. . Question #37 . This code segment assigns both variables the original value of num1. . Question #43 . This would be the value of result if the loop iterated one less time. . Question #44 . The remainder when 23 is divided by 4 is 3, so 23 MOD 4 is equal to 3. . Reflection . From this feedback, I think there are three misunderstandings/problems that I have:binary, the internet, and going to fast/not understanding directions.To fix this, I am going to go back to the previous CB videos and re-learn the internet and binary. I am also going to go slower and make sure that I understand the directions on future assignments. Specifically, I got questions 16 and 18 wrong because of my limited understanding of the internet. However, I was able to get some other questions correct about the internet, so it is only specific details which I forgot. For binary, questions 22 and 24 were missed. Again, I need to go back over what I don&#39;t understand in CB. Finally I the rest of the questions I got wrong were because I did not read the directions/code correctly. In the future, I will dedicate more time to reading the directions and get better at comprehending code .",

My plan for this project is to: . 1: Make a basic draft in applab to get an idea for how it works | 2: Then use this blog to blueprint a more advanced and streamlined version of original | 3: Combine the blueprint and parts of the original code to make the final project | . Drafting: . For my draft, I used a basic repeating code structure over and over again to create a basic quiz . . Blueprinting: . To plan my final quiz, I wanted to see what was good and bad about my draft: . Pros Cons . Easy to code | Confusing code; so it would be hard to add more features to | . N/A | Not unique | . To keep the simple code but make it less confusing, for the final product I will add a function that does the repeating code for me | To make the quiz more unique, I will add a game to the end: You will have to click on diamonds as they fall, and the points you get on the quiz will determine how many you can let fall during the game before losing | . Design, Successes, Discoveries and Challenges . Key Idea How I used it . Program Purpose and Function | The purpose and function of my program is to present the user with a quiz they enjoy | . Data Abstraction | One example of data abstraction in my quiz is all of the separate score labels on each page all using the same int variable to control them | . Managing Complexity | I used comments and methods to organize my code in a clear and concise way | . Procedural Abstraction | I added a lot of methods with inputs for they could be used in similar but slightly different ways, like my checkGuess(guess, answer, levelToGoTo) method uses the parameters to be able to check different questions and go to a different page every time | . Algorithm Implementation | Algorithms are used in my program to check multiple questions and to manage multiple button objects representing diamonds | . Testing | I used various console.log statements to be able to find problems | . The Final Product .
