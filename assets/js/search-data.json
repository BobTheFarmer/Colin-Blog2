This will allow you to understand how technology works and develop solutions to problems. Additionally, it is important to be adaptable and open to learning new technologies, as the field is constantly evolving and changing. It is also important to be able to work well in a team, as many tech projects require collaboration and communication with other developers and stakeholders. Furthermore, critical thinking and problem-solving skills are essential in the tech industry, as they can help you identify and solve complex problems. Overall, having a combination of these skills can help you succeed in the tech industry and pursue a fulfilling and successful career. . Interviews are an important part of the hiring process in the tech industry. They provide a way for companies to evaluate the skills and qualifications of potential employees and determine if they would be a good fit for the organization. . During a tech interview, candidates may be asked to solve coding challenges or puzzles, explain their approach to solving a problem, or demonstrate their knowledge of a specific technology or programming language. The interviewer may also ask about a candidate’s past projects and experiences, as well as their goals and interests in the tech field. . It is important for candidates to prepare for a tech interview by researching the company and the specific role they are applying for, brushing up on their technical skills, and practicing their problem-solving and communication abilities.

Parrots is false because it is set to dogs, before dogs was set to cats, making it false. Cats is also false because it is set to parrots, which is false, at the very end. | . numPups = 0 numCats = 40 numParrots = 10 . numCats ⟵ numParrots/10 numParrots ⟵ numCats/10 numPups ⟵ numCats+numParrots numCats ⟵ numParrots/numCats numParrots ⟵ numCats+numPups . numPups: 5 | numCats: 5 | numParrots: 10 numPups is equal to 5, because it is equal 40/10+10/10, or 5. numCats is 5 because 5/1 = 5 as well. numParrots is set to 5+5 at the very end, making it 10. | .

Variables like strings, numbers, characters, and more can be bundled together | It could be empty from the start and you can add more variables as needed | If you set one list equal to another list, or transfer data from one list to another, the data will be completely replaced. | You can also append data from one list to another, keeping the old data and adding the new data. | . Key Vocabulary . list: a sequence of several variables grouped together | variable: a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used | data types: a set of values and operations on those values | abstract data types: a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client | client: a program that uses a data type | objects: a structure that can take on a data-type value | Applications programming interface (API): which is a list of constructors and instance methods or operations, used to specify the behavior of an abstract data type | . Big Ideas . Lists can store any types of elements. | In all lists operations, if a list index is less than 1 or greater than the length of the list, an error message is made and the program will terminate. | Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation. | 1.

In this blog I will go over some of the art and projects I saw from different classes during my visit, organized by class. I will also go over my new inspiration. Finally, I will blog about the AP exam and what need to change in the future. . N@TM . 3D Animation . 3D Animation is a very cool class and I liked looking at the art. It was interesting because of the variety 3D animation allows. There were all sorts of art, like: . Realism | Abstract | A mix between both It was also cool because it is another class that deals with computers | . Visual Arts . Visual arts was the class I spent the longest in excluding computers science. The art was very impressive and I enjoyed this section a lot. This art inspired me to be more thoghtful in my work for this class. . Computer Science . The various computer science projects that other groups made were very cool and impressive. One of my favorite projects was Code hoots. It had random computer science questions that the user got to answer. The project was very polished, you could even make an account and the buttons had custom animations. This project in particular inspires me to be more careful with my projects in the future. . Images . . College board final corrections . I got a 41/50 on this test. Here is what I did wrong and should change next time: . Missed questions . Feedback from CB on each missed question . Question #5 . Information about which restaurants Brandon and Cynthia have visited in the past is not needed. Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. . Question #16 . Messages are broken into as many packets as are needed to transmit the data. Each packet contains both data and metadata. . Question #18 . The Internet is not a data stream. . Question #22 . Binary 0110 is equivalent to 2^2+21. . Question #24 . Binary 1101 is equivalent to decimal 13 and should be placed after decimal 12. . Question #35 . This code segment assigns maxPS the value 50 when time &gt; 120 and assigns maxPS the value 30 otherwise. . Question #37 . This code segment assigns both variables the original value of num1. . Question #43 . This would be the value of result if the loop iterated one less time. . Question #44 . The remainder when 23 is divided by 4 is 3, so 23 MOD 4 is equal to 3. . Reflection . From this feedback, I think there are three misunderstandings/problems that I have:binary, the internet, and going to fast/not understanding directions.To fix this, I am going to go back to the previous CB videos and re-learn the internet and binary. I am also going to go slower and make sure that I understand the directions on future assignments. Specifically, I got questions 16 and 18 wrong because of my limited understanding of the internet. However, I was able to get some other questions correct about the internet, so it is only specific details which I forgot. For binary, questions 22 and 24 were missed. Again, I need to go back over what I don&#39;t understand in CB. Finally I the rest of the questions I got wrong were because I did not read the directions/code correctly. In the future, I will dedicate more time to reading the directions and get better at comprehending code .",

Drafting: . For my draft, I used a basic repeating code structure over and over again to create a basic quiz . . Blueprinting: . To plan my final quiz, I wanted to see what was good and bad about my draft: . Pros Cons . Easy to code | Confusing code; so it would be hard to add more features to | . N/A | Not unique | . To keep the simple code but make it less confusing, for the final product I will add a function that does the repeating code for me | To make the quiz more unique, I will add a game to the end: You will have to click on diamonds as they fall, and the points you get on the quiz will determine how many you can let fall during the game before losing | .

Data Abstraction | One example of data abstraction in my quiz is all of the separate score labels on each page all using the same int variable to control them | . Managing Complexity | I used comments and methods to organize my code in a clear and concise way | .

Algorithm Implementation | Algorithms are used in my program to check multiple questions and to manage multiple button objects representing diamonds | . Testing | I used various console.log statements to be able to find problems | . The Final Product .

Didn’t originally like the class but doing knows it’s important for aerospace . COGSIN major (psychology+CS); CS gave the technical background for it . Always interested in CS from a young age, took it more seriously in middle and high school and APCSP helped with that . What is the biggest challenge you’ve faced? . Getting started; remember there is a solution on the internet(2x) . Clashing egos; CS egos are not the kindest people . Theory behind CS; in college it is not structured the same . Finding motivation; someone will always be better . Temptation to cut corners, not everything is a checkbox for points . Starting in a new area of CS .
