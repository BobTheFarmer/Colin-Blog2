    "Algorithm efficiency refers to how well a computer program performs in terms of its usage of resources such as time and memory. An efficient algorithm can complete its tasks quickly and with minimal use of resources, while an inefficient algorithm may take a long time to complete or use up a large amount of memory.\n",

    "Undecidable problems are problems for which there is no known algorithm that can always produce a correct solution. These problems are typically impossible to solve using a computer program, as there is no way to guarantee that the program will always find the correct solution. Examples of undecidable problems include the halting problem and the problem of determining whether a given statement in a formal system is true or false.\n",
