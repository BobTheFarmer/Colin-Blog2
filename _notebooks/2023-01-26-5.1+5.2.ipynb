    "## Pros and Cons of developing technolgy\n",
    "- Beneficial Effect: Advancements in robotics and automation through the use of computational models and algorithms in manufacturing and industrial processes.\n",
    "- Harmful Effect: Job displacement and income inequality as certain tasks and roles become automated, particularly in low-skilled and low-wage positions. Additionally, there is a risk of reduced worker safety as automation and robots may replace human workers in hazardous environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beneficial Effect: Improved financial services through the use of big data and artificial intelligence in banking and financial markets.\n",
    "- Harmful Effect: Increased financial inequality as certain individuals and groups may have limited access to these services or may be excluded from the benefits of these technologies due to factors such as income or credit score. Additionally, there is a risk of bias and discrimination in decision-making based on data-driven predictions, particularly in areas such as lending and insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beneficial Effect: Enhanced national security through the use of surveillance and facial recognition technology.\n",
    "- Harmful Effect: Invasion of privacy, particularly for individuals who may be targeted for surveillance based on their race, religion, or political beliefs. Additionally, there is a risk of false positives and false negatives in facial recognition technology, which can lead to individuals being wrongly targeted or not identified in situations where identification is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers and technology have changed the way we live and work in a lot of ways. They've made things faster and easier, like how we can order groceries online or video call our friends and family across the world. They've also helped us make breakthroughs in medicine, transportation, and energy. And let's not forget how much easier it is to bank and shop online.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, computers and technology can also lead to job losses, privacy issues, and even addiction. And not everyone has equal access to all the benefits of technology, which can widen the gap even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, it's important to remember that computers and technology are just tools. They can be used for good or bad, it depends on how we use them. While we need to be aware of the negative effects, we should also focus on the positive impact they've had on our lives and the world we live in.\n",

    "## Dopamine and it's issues\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that dopamine is a real problem that should be taken much more seriously. Anthony Rosner describes his grades and life being damaged a lot by his gaming addiction. I think that these issues should be taken more seriously and not be thought of as some kind of conspiracy to prevent kids from playing to many video games. \n",
    "\n",
    "This text definitely made me think about my own use of technology, like phones and video games. I want to avoid neglecting my relationships and schoolwork. Being a student in high school, I think this is important for both me and my peers to remember how much time we spend on screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I think it is also important to remember that everyone has their own responsibilitys and that what works for one person may not work for another. Some people will be able to play more videogames or spend more time on their phones while others may fall out of touch and productiviy when they spend too much time on their phones. Whats really important is to try and mantian a balance between their personal lives and their dopamine. \n",

    "## Digital empowerment\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought of three ways to help empower yourself in the digital world: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish clear boundaries for a balance: One very important way to become digitally empowered is to establish a clear line of how much time you spend on your devices. One really good strategy for this is to use tools like screen time on certain apps to set limits or disable them during certain hours of the day. These boundaries make sure you do not spend too much time chasing dopamine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Digital footprint: Online behavior can affect us in the real world too so we need to remember that and be mindful of our digital footprint. We could be careful about what we post and think before we post any information that is too personal. If we are mindful of our digital footprint, we make sure that our online behavior could never harm us in the real world and we make sure we control our digital identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. However, we can also use technology to empower ourselves by taking control of our technology and taking advantage of its benefits. Applications can be used to keep us organized or to help us focus on our work. Social media can also be used to connect with people who share similar interests. If we use technology to help us we can truly become digitally empowered.\n",

    "## Steps to help with digital enpowerment at DNHS\n",
    "\n",
    "Education about digital safety can be very important at school to help students practice online safety. Some good ways to do this include presentations about digital safety which can be made in class, informational materials, and clubs which are for teaching this. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more way to help people to become digitally empowered is to help stand up against negative things on the internet, like cyberbullying. We can do this by helping people who are targeted and by educating people about the problems that can come with cyberbullying. Also, it is very helpful to share your resources about how to be digitally empowered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a person who is empowered can also help by being a role model. This can be done by demonstrating positive digital habits and being mindful of how one's actions online can affect others. Additionally, being an active participant in online communities and promoting healthy and positive digital interactions can also be a way to empower others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can be a role model to help others become empowered. We can be role models by showing others good digital habits and by being extremely mindful of how your actions can affect people on the internet. Participating in communities online and using good digital habits can be a good way to help others improve their digital empowerment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](my_icons/redTape.jpg)\n",
    "## Barriers to digital empowerment\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many barriers which can prevent people from becoming digitally empowered. The biggest barrier is when people do not have access to technology. This could be caused by a lack of enough money to afford rapidly evolving tech or having no internet access. In addition, schools in low income areas could not have enough resources to help those who don't have access to the internet\n",
    "\n",
    "Another barrier to digital empowerment is a lack of digital literacy skills. Many individuals may not have the knowledge or skills necessary to effectively use technology, which can prevent them from fully utilizing its potential. This is particularly true for older individuals or those who have not had much exposure to technology in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, some people never have the opportunity to become good at using tech and never get the skills to use technology effectivity which stops them from using it well and acts as a another barrier to using tech. This could become a even bigger problem for older people or people who have never used tech in the past."
