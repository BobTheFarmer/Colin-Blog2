    "The class and my partner talked about the incense in digital spying and how nothing is ever truly free. Products like google are paid for by your information and therefore advertising. We also talked about how patterns are usually a good thing. It allows for innovation to be profitable and therefor faster. However, we thought some copyrights are being held to advantage the companies holding them and not society. Companies like disney have held copyright over character for ridiculous amounts of time. I agree with the class here and also think the same things\n",

    "## Describe PII you have seen on a project in CompSci Principles.\n",
    "Many students have chosen to use a login in and sign up feature on their sites. This requires them to hold sensitive information in their databases. I think this is a good example of how PII can be a bad thing even if it is not malicious. I personally do not trust myself or my classmates with my information because none of our databases are necessarily secure.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?\n",
    "I use a variety of steps to keep my PII at a low online:\n",
    "- I always use a second email unless it is professional related\n",
    "- If a website requires a phone number, I use an emulator if they don't have protection against it\n",

    "## Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "Symmetric encryption uses 2 keys to both encrypt and decrypt the data. It is more simple to implement and makes sense for non commercial or indie products, like what we are working on. For large companies with massive amounts of private data, they need to use asymmetric encryption to keep their data highly secure. It uses only 1 secret key only on the backend\n",

    "## Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.\n",
    "Some people used encryption to store passwords on a public api. I thought this was a cool idea and researched it. I think it is an effective approach but I also think it would make more sense to implement a password checker which returns a unique account key every time you log in\n",
